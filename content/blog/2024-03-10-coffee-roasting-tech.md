I love having an idea and being able to bring it to life.

One of my side projects after seeing some really cool demos of image recognition was to apply it to my coffee roasting hobby. Could I train a model to recognize the color of coffee beans as they roast? Could I use this to help me roast better coffee?

The [Neuralception blog](https://www.neuralception.com/objectdetection) did the heavy lifting. [Roboflow](https://blog.roboflow.com/training-a-yolov3-object-detection-model-with-a-custom-dataset/) has great tutorials and an easy to use platform for fine-tuning models. The Thermoworks team was really helpful in sharing access to their BlueDot SDK. And of course, shoutout to ChatGPT in helping me move fast with new syntax and learning concepts to make this all happen.

As AI/ML becomes more advanced, I hope it stays accessible. I hope the 16 year old kid with a laptop can build and discover the next breakthrough. I hope we build small models as much as we build large models. I hope we continue to share and learn generously.
