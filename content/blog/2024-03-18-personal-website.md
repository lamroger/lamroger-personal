There are lots of options on how and where to host a personal website.

* Netlify
* Vercel
* GitHub Pages
* AWS
* Cloudflare Pages
* and many more

I'm recommending GitHub Pages because it's free, easy to use, and integrates well with GitHub.

They have straightforward guide to start [here](https://pages.github.com/).

You can start with raw HTML and CSS. [Andrej Karpathy](https://karpathy.ai/) uses this approach.

Another option is to use a static site generator. [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) are
popular.

One thing to worry about spending too much time on configuration and customization. It's easy to get lost in the weeds
and forget about the content. I'm guilty of this.

To connect your static site generator to GitHub Pages, google "hugo github pages" or "jekyll github pages" and follow
the instructions that come up. Since lots of people do this, you'll find lots of resources and generally one way of
doing it.

Github Pages also supports
[custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) so you can
use your own domain name too!
