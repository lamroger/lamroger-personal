My name is Roger, a software engineer based in Los Angeles.

In my spare time, I contribute to (or at least try to contribute to) [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/) and write about what I'm learning to share and inspire others.

I'm also teaching DATA4800: Generative AI at John Carroll University and am an alumni of UCLA and the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/).

With a north star of combining math and computer science for social good.
