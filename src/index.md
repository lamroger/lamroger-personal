Hey! My name is Roger Lam and I'm a software developer based in Baltimore, MD. I currently work at [Nava PBC](https://www.navapbc.com/careers/) (consider working here, it's great!). I enjoy working with backend and infrastructure systems and supporting others in achieving their aspirations.

Tune in for thoughts around software development, career experiences, and beginner bread baking.
