Baking sourdough bread has been a fun hobby. I have my starter in the fridge at the moment and feed it weekly.

Some supplies take an investment and feeding a starter can take some getting used to but it‚Äôs very satisfying to work with your hands, be absolutely terrible at it, take a bite at the end and hypothesize what to change next time.

This post is to document my thoughts and share the resources that helped me along the way. Still a work in progress post but take a look below.

If you decide to give it a try, send over a picture of your üçû!
