Baking sourdough bread has been somewhat of a hobby. I say somewhat because I‚Äôve only baked four loaves so far. My first loaves weren‚Äôt even from my own starter. My coworker gave me some of his after mine died from malnutrition. 

Even so, it‚Äôs been really fun and not too difficult. Some supplies take an investment and feeding a starter can take some getting used to but once you get the gist of it, it‚Äôs very satisfying to commit to baking and having it time boxed to completion. Unlike writing my first blog post for the fifth time or working on my next million dollar side project.

This post is to document my thoughts and share the resources that helped me along the way. If you decide to give it a try, send over a picture of your üçû!
